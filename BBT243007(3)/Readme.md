## Overview
This program is a simple C++ code that prints "Hello World" 161 times. It uses a for loop that starts at 0 and continues until the variable `m` reaches 160. Each iteration of the loop outputs the phrase "Hello World" followed by a newline.



## Example Output

Hello World
Hello World
...

```
(Note: The phrase "Hello World" will be printed 161 times in total.)
