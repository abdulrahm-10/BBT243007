## Overview
This Python program determines the season based on the month number entered by the user. The user inputs an integer representing a month (1 for January, 2 for February, etc.). The program checks the number and prints the corresponding season:
- 1 to 3: Summer
- 4 to 6: Winter
- 7 to 9: Spring
- 10 to 12: Autumn
If the input is not between 1 and 12, it prints "Invalid."
